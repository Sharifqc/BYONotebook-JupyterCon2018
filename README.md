# BYONotebook-JupyterCon2018
Preparing your Jupyter notebook for computationally reproducible publication: A hands-on, BYONotebook tutorial for researchers

# Abstract
This is a step-by-step, practical tutorial to prepare Jupyter notebooks for computationally reproducible publication. The tutorial starts with some brief introductory information about computational reproducibility, but the bulk of the tutorial is guided work. The basic best practices for publishing notebooks are covered, and participants move through organization, preparing their research for reuse, documentation, and submitting their notebook to share.

# Outline

## Essential information about computational reproducibility (teaching 20 mins / exercises 10 mins)
* Question: What is computational reproducibility?
* Learning objectives:
  * Define computational reproducibility and its relevance to researchers.
  * Explore examples of computationally reproducible research.
* Key points:
  * Computational reproducibility is the foundation upon which other forms of reproducibility may be built.
  * Benefits the researcher themselves as well as promotes progress and reuse in research.
  * Requires sharing of data, code, and computational environment necessary to rerun research code.

## Preparing your data for publication (teaching 10 mins / exercises 10 minutes)
* Question: How do we communicate important information about our data?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for data documentation.
* Key points:
  * Examine examples of well documented datasets.

## Preparing your Jupyter notebook for publication (teaching 10 mins / exercises 20 mins)
* Question: How do we prepare our notebooks for sharing?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for sharing.
  * Learn how to prepare your notebook to be used by others.
* Key points:
  * Use relative rather than absolute paths.
  * Create a master script that runs your code and/or notebooks in sequence.
  * Specify your environment and package versions.

## Documenting your research for reuse (teaching 10 mins / exercises 20 mins)
* Question: What information must I include for reuse?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for documentation.
  * Describe the FAIR Principles for discoverable research.
  * Prepare the minimum documentation for reuse.
* Key points:
  * Create a README file.
  * Include essential metadata.
  * Choose a licence.

## Sharing your Jupyter notebook (teaching 15 mins / exercises 35 mins)
* Question: How can I share my notebook reproducibly?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe possible tools and best practices for publishing notebooks.
  * Submit your notebook for publishing on Code Ocean.
* Key points:
  * There are many tools and platforms for sharing Jupyter notebooks.
  * Sharing a container rather than just your notebook improves reproducibility.
  * New tools can make configuring a container for research efficient.

## Integrating reproducibility into your research workflow (teaching 20 mins)
* Question: What are the practical steps a researcher can take to improve reproducibility?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for improving reproducibility throughout the research workflow
  * Describe tools to support reproducibility.
* Key points:
  * Plan for reproducibility from the start to save time through project organization and electronic lab notebooks.
  * Keep track of your research through preregistration, version control, and documentation.
  * Report and share your methods and materials completely and transparently.
